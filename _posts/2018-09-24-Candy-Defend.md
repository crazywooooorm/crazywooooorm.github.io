It is always hard to say no to candies, although it can cause many health problems:
overweight, heart disease, diabetes or depression. Yesterday, my parents
decided to cut candy consumption because they believed my current increasing candy
consumption was too much for a 13-year-old kid. It might be true, but I still
want to figure out some ways to defend my favorite snack: candy.

Here's the conversation between my mom and me in this morning:

**Mom:** You will not get any candies starting from next week since you are having
more and more candies recently, I don't want you to be 180 pounds at your age.

**Me:** But mom, how do you know I am having more and more candies?

**Mom:** Because I noticed that candies had an increasing percentage among all the
snacks you had.

**Me:** Okay, but if you check my total snack consumption, you will find that I
am actually having fewer snacks! See, I don't have as many chips or burgers like
before, compared to candy, other snacks can be more harmful to me!

**Mom:** Well, I think you will still have fewer snacks after I cut your candies.

**Me:** Probably, but the truth is I just like trying different candies, I don't
really take them too much. Last week I only tried one candy of each new flavor,
since then I didn't take them anymore. Also, sometimes I only have candies when
my friends recommend me, which doesn't happen very often.

**Mom:** You are taking few candies doesn't mean you will still take few in future.

**Me:** Good point! Compare to other snacks, candy doesn't make me addicted! My friend
Tom, he used to have just fried chicken, but now he can't stop himself and starts
taking burgers, cheese cakes and pizza every day! Candy is just candy, it doesn't
lead to anything else.

**Mom:** Listen, I don't want to waste too much time on arguing that. I have to work
now. If you can give me more evidence tonight, I might reconsider it.
