# Brief Summary of Nonparametric Statistics

## Basic

### Measurement

* Nominal (Classificatory Scale): Usually used to classify objects, each
subclass is mutual exclusive and equivalent.
* Ordinal (Ranking Scale): Nominal measurement but subclasses hold some order,
which makes them not equivalent from each other.
* Interval: Ordinal measurement but the distance between subclasses makes sense.
* Ratio: Interval measurement and has a true zero, which makes the ratio
calculation to be possible.

Difference between Interval scale and Ratio scale: Interval scale includes time
and temperature. You know the distance between data so you can do the add or
subtract operation, while you would never try to divide a time with another time
because their is no "zero time". Ratio scale, however, like weight or height, you
have "absolute zero", so you can do multiply or divide operation on this scale.
