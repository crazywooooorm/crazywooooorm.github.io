What is a typical approach to set a goal for product?

To answer this question, we need more information about the product we are talking about:
What is the product and how do we make profits?
If we are talking about social media company like facebook and twitter, we basically want more member engagement because most of our profits come from advertising. If we are talking about uber or airbnb, we basically want more people to take a ride or rent a room.
What is the stage of the company or product?
Knowing the product stage helps us identify which part of the user experience funnel to focus on (acquisition, conversion, engagement, retention, monetization). For a brand new product, we focus more on acquisition, conversion and engagement, while for a relatively mature product, we need to focus on all steps in the funnel.

Acquisition metrics:


Conversion metrics:


Engagement metrics:


Retention metrics:


Monetization metrics:
